I am a Machine Learning Engineer and Data Scientist with over three years of experience building scalable AI, data engineering, and machine learning systems. My work spans finance, robotics, and healthcare, where I have developed SBA loan classifiers, explainable AI tools using SHAP and LIME, and semantic search systems powered by RAG and GPT-4o. I regularly work with Airflow, MLflow, and Docker, and have deployed models on AWS, GCP, and Azure. I am deeply interested in Generative AI and large language models, especially in making intelligent systems more interpretable and useful for real business applications.

Recently, I worked at Void Robotics on developing ROS2-based computer vision and navigation systems using YOLO and SLAM for real-time robotic perception. At Mercor, I focused on evaluating reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs and building robust data science solutions. Earlier, at Parlay Finance, I created an SBA loan eligibility classification system that improved model accuracy and reduced loan processing times significantly. My research experience at NIT Trichy led to the development of ResCoWNet, a convolutional neural network for medical image denoising that was later published in a peer-reviewed journal. I completed my master’s in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder and my bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Trichy.
